#Servers
#CoAP_server.py file is the script on python that is being running on the raspberry py for the CoAP server.
#Node-red-flows.json are the flows used to make the configuration of the simulation scenario data processing and data visualization

#Microcontrollers, this code is configurated to the devices and Network of its simulation placed
#ESP32_CoAP is the arduino code for coAP client of the same
#ESP8266_HTTP is the arduino code for HTTP client microcontroller
#ESP2866_MQTT is the arduino code sample for use MQTT client microcontrollers ESP8266(the code is similar to all, but need to change adresses)
#YUN_MQTT is the arduino code for YUN microcontoller that use MQTT as client.


#attacks documentation.txt is the documentation and procedures of the cyber atacks made to the system.

**The system was implemented following the real scenario:**
